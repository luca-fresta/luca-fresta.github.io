    I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bonn hosted by
    Prof. Stefan Müller.
    Previously, I was an SNSF fellow at the University of Bonn and worked with
    Prof. Massimiliano Gubinelli.
    I received my Ph.D. in 2020 from the University of Zurich, under the supervision
    of Prof. Marcello Porta.
