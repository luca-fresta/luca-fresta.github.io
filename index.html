  <p>
    I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Bonn hosted by
    Prof. Stefan Müller.
    Previously, I was an SNSF fellow at the University of Bonn and worked with
    Prof. Massimiliano Gubinelli.
    I received my Ph.D. in 2020 from the University of Zurich, under the supervision
    of Prof. Marcello Porta.

  <h2>Research</h2>
  <p>
    My research interests include stochastic analysis, singular stochastic
    partial differential equations, and mathematical statistical physics,
    with a focus on supersymmetric methods and probabilistic representations.
